## Tools Used

- Kali Linux Machine
- Linux Command Line Tools


## Steps Used

####  Identifying The Config.conf File
- Locate the config.conf file from the system using Linux commands. The following screen shots show how the config,conf file was located.

####  Analyzing File Permissions
- Use the cd, ls - l commands to change directory and list the content and file permission of config.conf file.

- Interprete the file permission
  

####  Analyzing MD5 Hash Values

- Use the md5sum command to analyze the MD5 has value of the file to check for the intergrity of the file.

- Use the vim editing tool to edit the config.conf file and check the MD5 hash value again.

- Check the MD5 hash value of the config.conf file and compare the hash value to the first hash value. If there is a change in the hash values that indicates that the file has been compromised. Below is the second MD5 hash value.
